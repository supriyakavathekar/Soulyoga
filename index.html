          I cannot express enough how grateful I am for choosing Himalaya Yoga
          Valley to equip me with the tools I needed to feel confident as a
          teacher. The course had the perfect balance between all elements of
          traditional yoga. The teachers were experienced, supportive, and
          knowledgeable across the board. I felt extremely safe throughout my
          time at the yoga centre, which was something I felt a little
          apprehensive about before embarking on my journey. I would highly
          recommend this teacher training for those wanting to learn from a
          traditional school that's close to the source of the yoga.
